# mlpack-reinforcement-learning
Reinforcement learning implementation based on recent ideas using mlpack

# TODO List
- Test existing algorithm

# DONE List
- Connection to an OpenAI Gym REST API.

# TIMELINE
- Week1(11/11 ~ 11/17)
    - Apprehend mlpack codebase.
    - Study c++ template metaprogramming.
    
- Week2(11/18 ~ 11/24)
    - Select one paper about Reinforcement learning.
    - Read and implement the algorithms.

- Week3(11/14 ~ 12/1)
    - Compare performance difference between existing RL algorithm and new algorithm.

# Objectives
1. Implementation of recent reinforcement learning algorithm using mlpack
2. Performance research that shows benchmark among the algorithms
